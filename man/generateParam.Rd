\arguments{
\item{ematrix}{The input expression matrix.}
}

Parameters formatted in a data.frame.

\description{
Generate parameters for HMM
}
\details{
\code{e}: Probability of extending a segment, increase to lengthen segments,
decrase to shorten segments. Range: (0, 1)

\code{strength}: Strength of initial e suggestion, reducing allows e to
change, increasing makes e undefiable. Range: [0, Inf)

\code{mu}: Suggested median for copy numbers in state, change to readjust
classification of states. Range: (-Inf, Inf)

\code{lambda}: Suggested precision (inversed variance) for copy numbers in
state, increase to reduce overlap between states. Range: [0, Inf)

\code{nu}: Suggested degree of freedom between states, increase to reduce
overlap between states. Range: [0, Inf)

\code{kappa}: Suggested distribution of states. Should sum to 1.

\code{m}: Optimal value for mu, difference from corresponding mu value
determines elasticity of the mu value. i.e. Set to identical value as mu if you don't want mu to move much.

\code{eta}: Mobility of mu, increase to allow more movement. Range: [0, Inf)

\code{gamma}: Prior shape on lambda, gamma distribution. Effects flexibility
of lambda.

\code{S}: Prior scale on lambda, gamma distribution. Effects flexibility of
lambda.
